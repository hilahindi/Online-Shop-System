# Ecommerce Management System 

A comprehensive Ecommerce platform developed in Java, demonstrating advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and robust system architecture.

## 🛠 Technical Highlights
* **Manager Class Architecture**: Implemented a central `SystemManager` class to handle all business logic, ensuring a clean separation from the user interface (Main).
* **Inheritance & Polymorphism**: Developed a polymorphic product system (e.g., `PackagedProduct` inheriting from `Product`) to manage diverse inventory types.
* **Custom Exception Handling**: Integrated specialized exceptions like `EmptyCartException` to handle invalid shopping operations gracefully.
* **Dynamic Memory Management**: Custom implementation of dynamic arrays that resize efficiently (Factor of 2) to optimize performance.
* **Data Organization**: Utilized specialized classes for data management, including structured addresses and order history.



## 🎮 System Capabilities
1. **User Management**: Separate workflows for Buyers and Sellers with unique identification.
2. **Product Catalog**: Advanced management of products with automated categorization and pricing logic.
3. **Order Lifecycle**: Full tracking from active shopping carts to persistent order history.
4. **Input Validation**: Strictly enforced data integrity by validating all user inputs against specific ranges and types.
